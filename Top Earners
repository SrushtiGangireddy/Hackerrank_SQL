We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.


select * from 
(select sal_earned, count(*) from
(select employee_id, name, sum(months*salary) sal_earned from employee
group by employee_id, name)
 group by sal_earned
order by sal_earned desc) sub1
where rownum=1;
